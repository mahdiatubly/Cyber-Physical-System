In the control system, there are 4 main parts:
  - Sensors: a device that is used to sense a physical phenomenon.
  - System: The object that wants to control and apply changes.
  - Actuator: the device that is used to alter or adjust the system or the environment. 
  - Controller: the device that is used to control the change in the system.

** Open-Loop System **: is a system with just a controller, and actuator with no sensor; it is a system without feedback.

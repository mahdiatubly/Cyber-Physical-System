- In the control system, there are 4 main parts:
  - Sensors: a device that is used to sense a physical phenomenon.
  - System: The object that wants to control and apply changes.
  - Actuator: the device that is used to alter or adjust the system or the environment. 
  - Controller: the device that is used to control the change in the system.

- **Open-Loop Control System**: is a system with just a controller, and actuator with no sensor; it is a system without feedback.
  
- **Closed-Loop Control System**: is a system that utilizes an extra component that compares the actual output with the desired output. (the measure of the output is called the feedback signal)

- **Multioop Feedback Control System**: a system with more than one type of sensor and controller that monitors different factors in the system.

- **Industrial Control Systems**:  ICSs, are a subset of cyber-physical systems.  ICSs are automation systems that provide control and monitoring functions in industrial facilities. They combine
different system types like process control systems, distributed control systems, supervisory control and data acquisition systems, safety instrumented systems, and more.

- **Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems**: are used for controlling, monitoring, and analyzing industrial devices and processes. The system consists of both software and hardware components and enables remote and on-site gathering of data from the industrial equipment.

- **Historian**: As the task executes, the results are recorded in a database called a historian.

- Modbus/TCP | DNP3: application layer layer protocols that are used in industrial control systems (non-routable protocols but there are new routable versions of them).
